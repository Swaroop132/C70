      <p class="text-muted">The college stage and auditorium that you see today, has come through a historic process of
        evolution and gradual transformation. The earliest roots of this stage goes back to the ‘Sans Soucci Theatre’,
        which was burned down by fire in 1843. But the spirit of Sans Soucci survived the holocaust, and in 1859, when
        the premises became the property of Belgain Jesuits, who called it St. Xavier’s, theatre came to life again. The
        St. Xavier’s stage found a place of pride in the cultural life of Calcutta.
